# Work and Rest Timer Toggle Button (2025-04-26 12:17:15)

_**User**_

i want to add a button to toggle between "work" and "rest". the "Work" button sets the timer to 25 minutes, the "Rest" sets it to 5

I'll help you modify the HTML to add a work/rest toggle button. I'll first read the current HTML file to understand the structure, and then make the necessary changes.

Let me edit the HTML file to add the work/rest toggle button:


---

```diff
          </div>
          <span class="mode-selector">
-             <button class="mode active" data-time="25">Pomodoro</button>
-             <button class="mode" data-time="5">Short Break</button>
-             <button class="mode" data-time="15">Long Break</button>
+             <button class="mode active" id="work-mode">Work (25 min)</button>
+             <button class="mode" id="rest-mode">Rest (5 min)</button>
          </span>
      </div>
```

---

I've made the following changes to the HTML:
1. Replaced the three mode buttons (Pomodoro, Short Break, Long Break) with two buttons: Work and Rest
2. Added clear labels showing the duration for each mode
3. Added specific IDs to the buttons for easier JavaScript targeting
4. Kept the "active" class on the Work button by default

Now you'll need to update your JavaScript to handle these new buttons. Would you like me to help you with the JavaScript changes as well? I can help you implement the functionality to:
1. Toggle between work and rest modes
2. Update the timer display accordingly
3. Handle the active state of the buttons

Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with the JavaScript changes!

please proceed

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you implement the JavaScript functionality for the work/rest toggle. First, let me check if there's an existing script.js file and its contents.


---

Read file: script.js

---

I'll now update the JavaScript to work with our new work/rest toggle functionality. The main changes needed are:
1. Update the mode handling to work with the new button IDs
2. Set the correct time values for work (25 minutes) and rest (5 minutes)
3. Remove the data-time attributes since we'll handle the times directly in the code

```diff
  class PomodoroTimer {
      constructor() {
-         this.timeLeft = 30 * 60; // 30 minutes in seconds
+         this.timeLeft = 25 * 60; // 25 minutes in seconds (work mode default)
          this.timerId = null;
          this.isRunning = false;
          this.pauseButton = document.getElementById('pause');
          this.resetButton = document.getElementById('reset');
-         this.modeButtons = document.querySelectorAll('.mode');
+         this.workModeButton = document.getElementById('work-mode');
+         this.restModeButton = document.getElementById('rest-mode');
          
          // Event Listeners
          this.startButton.addEventListener('click', () => this.start());
          this.pauseButton.addEventListener('click', () => this.pause());
          this.resetButton.addEventListener('click', () => this.reset());
-         this.modeButtons.forEach(button => {
-             button.addEventListener('click', () => this.setMode(button));
-         });
+         this.workModeButton.addEventListener('click', () => this.setWorkMode());
+         this.restModeButton.addEventListener('click', () => this.setRestMode());
          
          this.updateDisplay();
      reset() {
          this.pause();
-         this.timeLeft = parseInt(document.querySelector('.mode.active').dataset.time) * 60;
+         if (this.workModeButton.classList.contains('active')) {
+             this.timeLeft = 25 * 60; // 25 minutes
+         } else {
+             this.timeLeft = 5 * 60; // 5 minutes
+         }
          this.updateDisplay();
      }
      
-     setMode(button) {
-         this.modeButtons.forEach(btn => btn.classList.remove('active'));
-         button.classList.add('active');
+     setWorkMode() {
+         this.workModeButton.classList.add('active');
+         this.restModeButton.classList.remove('active');
+         this.reset();
+     }
+     
+     setRestMode() {
+         this.restModeButton.classList.add('active');
+         this.workModeButton.classList.remove('active');
          this.reset();
      }
```

I've updated the JavaScript code with the following changes:

1. Changed the default time to 25 minutes (work mode)
2. Replaced the generic mode buttons with specific work/rest mode buttons
3. Added dedicated `setWorkMode()` and `setRestMode()` methods
4. Updated the reset functionality to use the correct time based on the active mode
5. Simplified the mode switching logic

The timer should now work as follows:
- By default, it starts in work mode (25 minutes)
- Clicking the "Work" button sets the timer to 25 minutes
- Clicking the "Rest" button sets the timer to 5 minutes
- The active mode is visually indicated by the button styling
- The timer will reset to the appropriate time when switching modes

You can now use the timer with the work/rest toggle functionality. Would you like me to make any adjustments to the behavior or styling?

_**User**_

no, thanks

---

_**Assistant**_

You're welcome! The timer should now be working with the work/rest toggle functionality. You can:
- Start with 25 minutes in work mode
- Switch to 5 minutes in rest mode
- Use the start, pause, and reset buttons as before

Let me know if you need any other changes or have questions!

_**User**_

this is great but the blue button that says "pomodoro" should say "work mode". can you change this?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you change the text from "Pomodoro" to "Work Mode" in the title. Let me update the HTML file:



---

```diff
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
-     <title>Pomodoro Timer</title>
+     <title>Work Mode Timer</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
      <div class="container">
-         <h1>Pomodoro Timer</h1>
+         <h1>Work Mode Timer</h1>
          <div class="timer">
              <div class="time-display">25:00</div>
```

---

I've updated both the page title and the main heading to say "Work Mode Timer" instead of "Pomodoro Timer". The change has been applied successfully. Let me know if you'd like any other adjustments!
