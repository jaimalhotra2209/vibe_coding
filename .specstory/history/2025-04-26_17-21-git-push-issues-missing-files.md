# Git Push Issues: Missing Files (2025-04-26 13:21:24)

_**User**_

why have the readme and todo files not been pushed to my git?

---

_**Assistant**_

There are a few common reasons why your `README` and `ToDo.md` files might not have been pushed to your git repository:

1. **They haven’t been added to git:**  
   You need to run `git add README.md ToDo.md` (or whatever the filenames are) to stage them for commit.

2. **They haven’t been committed:**  
   After adding, you need to commit:  
   `git commit -m "Add README and ToDo files"`

3. **They haven’t been pushed:**  
   After committing, you need to push:  
   `git push`

4. **They are in .gitignore:**  
   If your `.gitignore` file lists these files or their directory, git will ignore them.

5. **You’re on a different branch:**  
   If you created or committed these files on a branch that hasn’t been pushed, they won’t appear in the remote repository.

**How to check:**

- Run `git status` to see if the files are untracked or staged.
- Check your `.gitignore` for any rules that might exclude these files.
- Make sure you’re on the correct branch with `git branch`.

If you want, I can help you check your `.gitignore` or walk you through the git commands! Let me know if you want to see the exact steps or need help with a specific part.

how do i commit all the files in this folder?

---

_**Assistant**_

To commit all the files in your current folder (and its subfolders) to git, follow these steps in your terminal:

1. **Stage all files:**  
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```
   This stages all new, modified, and deleted files in the current directory and all subdirectories.

2. **Commit the changes:**  
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   ```
   Replace "Your commit message here" with a brief description of your changes.

3. **Push to your remote repository (e.g., GitHub):**  
   ```sh
   git push
   ```

**Summary:**  
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push
```
